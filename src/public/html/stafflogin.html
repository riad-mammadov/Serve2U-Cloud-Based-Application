<!-- For this page a tutorial was followed for the authentication using cognito, as it was the first time implementing and using 
    AWS Cognito  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQfA7OQEMqg&list=PLPMbb3KXRmigGdxkvrGfR4RmsU4J78_BQ

This tutorial works on setting up all the routes and endpoints necessary, giving me a base to start off with, as to which i then implemented
to work with the input field in the form whilst adding other functionalities such as a staff login where a user must be registered as a staff
on the AWS Cognito User Pool in order to be able to log in as a staff
